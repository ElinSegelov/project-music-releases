# Project: Music Releases
For week five of the Technigo bootcamp (first week of the React sprint) our assignment was to create a music relese feed using json data. We were given a specific design and the site had to be responsive. This project was made in collaboration with Sarah Kneedler.

This week we practice React by creating components and using data from Spotify. You will build a page which shows new album and single releases. This project was done using pair programming and branches. 

## The problem
This was out first project using React. We have created varius components passing props from the json-data. We used Kanban for planning and assigning tasks, allthough we were mostyly pair-programming. 

If we had more time to work on the project we would make the site more accessebile.
