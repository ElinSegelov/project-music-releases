# Music Releases
Assignment:

This week we practice React by creating components and using data from Spotify. You will build a page which shows new album and single releases. This project was done using pair programming and branches. 

## The problem
**What you need to do**
✓ Your app should have components

✓ Your page should look as close as possible to the design provided.

✓ You should display the following for each album:
    - album cover image
    - album name
    - the name of each artist involved with a comma between

✓ Hover effects:
    - When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
    - When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
    - Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch

✓ When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data

✓ When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data

✓ Your page should be responsive:
    - showing 4 albums per row on desktop
    - 2 per row on tablet
    - 1 per row on mobile.


We used React, JavaScrips, JSON-data, CSS and JSX to solve the assignment. We started off in one master branch, beginning with creating components and the base of the code and targeting the JSON-data. We used Trello for planning. If we had more time we would aim for the last strech goals and add accessebility feautures.
